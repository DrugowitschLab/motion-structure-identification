# Motion structure identification in visual perception

Taking a normative Bayesian perspective on the visual perception of motion structure, this project investigates if and how human observers can identify statistical motion relations in dynamic scenes when all other stimulus features are uninformative. Having an ideal observer model at hand, we can quantitatively assess human motion structure perception when presented scenes are stochastic and potentially ambiguous. The study can contribute to our understanding of the visual integration of unreliable cues as well as on latent motion priors underlying human perception.

The research was started as a summer project with Sichao Yang, supervised by Johannes Bill, Jan Drugowitsch and Sam Gershman. It builds on existing work by J. Bill, H. Pailian, S. Gershman and J. Drugowitsch (2019).
